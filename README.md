> Various partially completed resources :bookmark_tabs:

## Description

The **scratchpad** repository holds a variety of projects and resources in various states of completion. This is primarily for:

- future resource reference
- best practices and patterns
- third-party package usage examples
- helpful snippets and tools
- etc.

Basically, this will hold anything that isn't expected to be supported long-term although ideas here may eventually be spun out into their own project.
